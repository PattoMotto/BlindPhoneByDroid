### BlindPhone ByDroid
The blind people have many problems to use smart phone that usaully comes with
Touch Screen without any physical keyboard. Because the blind has problem with visual so
they have to use touch and sound to recognize things. Many apps in Android platform can
help blind people to have a better live but most of blind people can’t use those apps
easily because the programmer doesn’t design the user interface for blind.
So that we have been developed “BlindPhone ByDroid” as User Interface
Framework that designed for every blind people for example Color Blindness, Complete
Blindness, Visually Impaired (low vision). This Framework aims to developers can make their
apps for the blind with the same functions easier. So that there will be better apps from
more developers for blinds and that will improve quality of life for blind and visually
impaired.
